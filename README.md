# Holography and Hydrodynamics with Dynamical Gauge Fields
We add the ancillary Mathematica file about hydrodynamics with the dynamical gauge fields, which is consisting of the followings:
1. Dynamical matrix
2. Dispersion relation at zero density
3. Dispersion relation at finite dendity
4. Quasi-normal modes vs. Hydrodynamic predictions
